pancakes
========

**NOTE** - This is a work in progress and should not be used right now

Pancakes is a high-level, full-stack JavaScript framework. It was designed with the following
goals in mind:

1. **SEO** - Ability to pre-render content on the server, even for Single Page Apps. No need for PhantomJS or Fragment Spec hacks.
1. **DRY** - One template that can be rendered on the client or server. One module that
can be used at any layer. One common interface to multiple back ends. One unified Model object that
can be used anywhere (including all validations).
1. **Plugable Architecture** - Pancakes is not a web server framework. It is not a client side framework.
It is built to integration with any other framework on the web server (ex. Koa, Hapi, etc.) or the
client (ex. Angular, Backbone, etc.). Mix and match as you please!
1. **Testing** - Make it easy to unit test any and every module in the same way. Ability to test
 client side code on the server.
1. **Code Generation** - Heavy emphasis on auto generating scaffolding code and providing tools to
make development easy.

Although this framework is built for flexibility, it is opinionated. We will value making things
simple over providing options.

We are still working on making this library awesome, but we would love to know if you are interested
and would like to get involved. Hit me up on twitter @jeffwhelpley.
